# Python Data Structures Practice Lab

**Suggested repo name:** `python-data-structures-lab`  
**Short description:** Hands-on practice with Python lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and basic function usage.

## Overview

This repository contains a practice Jupyter notebook that demonstrates core Python programming concepts including lists, slicing, tuple unpacking, dictionaries, sets, function definitions, and iteration over structured data. It is intended for beginners to explore and reinforce fundamental Python data structures.

## Topics Covered

- Lists: indexing, slicing, membership, insertion, removal  
- Tuples: immutability, concatenation, function returns, unpacking  
- Dictionaries: creation, lookup, membership, dynamic updates  
- Sets: intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference  
- Functions: returning multiple values and unpacking  
- Iteration over sequences of tuples (e.g., structured records)
